<h1>Undirected Graph Visualization Help</h1>
Nodes
<ul>
  <li>Double-click an empty spot on the canvas to create a node.  By default nodes are labeled with consecutive integers.  (You may need to click once on the canvas to bring it to focus before double-clicking.)
  <li>Click and drag a node to move it around the canvas.
  <li>Click on an existing node to highlight it.  (Note this may be hard to see if you choose certain node colors.)  Once a node is highlighted:
  <ul>
    <li> Click the same node again to delete it and any edges that touch it.
    <li> Click a different node to add an edge between those two nodes
    <li> Simply start typing to change the label for the highlighted node.  Pressing enter or clicking a blank spot on the canvas ends the label creation.
  </ul>
</ul>
Edges
<ul>
  <li>Click on an edge to highlight it.  (Edge will turn green.)  Once an edge is highlighted:
  <ul>
    <li>Click the same edge to delete it.
    <li>Simply start typing to change the weight for that edge.  Pressing enter or clicking a blank sport on the canvas ends the label creation.
  </ul>
</ul>
Use the control panel to change node and text colors or clear the graph.<br>
Most browsers will allow you to right-click the canvas area and view the graph as an image so it can be saved.
